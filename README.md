## Special Thanks

Many thanks to the very talented Rock Barcellos for the creation and use of the above images. [https://twitter.com/rockbarcellos](https://twitter.com/rockbarcellos)

Andrew Toth, for releasing his bitcoin wallet under the MIT license. His architecture and code greatly influenced the technical design of ProTip. Further, Toth's code introduced me to the Promise pattern which greatly simplified and improved the performance of ProTip.
